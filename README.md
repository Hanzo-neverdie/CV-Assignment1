# CV-Assignment1

## Introduction

  This is an assignment of Computer Vision.The objective of this assignment is to use Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook, or any other suitable tool to detect text from images using OpenCV. This will help you understand the concepts of fundamental Computer Vision algorithms and techniques, evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of computer vision systems, and apply and implement these tools and techniques. 

* Setup Environment: <a href = "https://colab.research.google.com/">Google Colab platform</a>
* Load an Image:
  <a href = "https://github.com/Hanzo-neverdie/CV-Assignment1/blob/main/image_0.jpg">image_0</a>
  <a href = "https://github.com/Hanzo-neverdie/CV-Assignment1/blob/main/image_1.jpg">image_1</a>
  <a href = "https://github.com/Hanzo-neverdie/CV-Assignment1/blob/main/image_2.jpg">image_2</a>
  <a href = "https://github.com/Hanzo-neverdie/CV-Assignment1/blob/main/image_3.jpg">image_3</a>
* Pre-process the Image:
  
  1.Convert the image to grayscale.
  
  2.Apply necessary image processing techniques like thresholding, blurring, or edge detection to enhance text visibility.
  
* Text Detection: using EAST text detector
* Extract and Display Text: using tesseract
* Efficiency and  Effectiveness Evaluation:
